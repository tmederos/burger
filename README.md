## Overview
Eat the Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page in the "Burgers not Eaten" list. Each burger in the waiting area has an "Eat!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page in the "Burgers Eaten" list. The user can delete burgers from the "Burgers Eaten" list by clicking the "Delete" button. New burgers can be added to the "Burgers not Eaten" list by adding the new burger name in the "Add a Burger" field and clicking the Add Burger button. This app was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
